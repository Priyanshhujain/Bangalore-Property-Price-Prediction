Bangalore Property Price Prediction 

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts property prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. By analyzing historical data, we aim to provide insights and accurate forecasts for real estate prices in the region.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the trends and correlations in property prices.
Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) for price prediction.
Evaluation: Measuring model performance with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language
Pandas, Numpy: Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis
